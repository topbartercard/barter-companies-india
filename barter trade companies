1.	How to exchange in bartering?
Top Bartercard is the trading of one product or service for another. Usually there is no exchange of cash. Top Bartercard may take place on an informal one-on-one basis between individuals and businesses, or it can take place on a third party basis through a Top bartercard exchange company. A Top bartercard exchange is any person or organization with members or clients that contract with each other (or with the barter exchange) to jointly trade or Top bartercard property or services. The term does not include arrangements that provide solely for the informal exchange of similar services on a noncommercial basis.
Unlike one-on-one top bartercard, members of exchanges are not obligated to Top bartercard or purchase directly from a seller. Instead, when a Top bartercard exchange member sells a product or a service to another member, their barter account is credited for the fair market value of the sale. When a top bartercard exchange member buys, the account is debited for the fair market value of the purchase.

Pure Internet-based Top bartercard companies differ from traditional, organized trade exchanges in that they do not have a physical office.
